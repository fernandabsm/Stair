# Stair

We say that a sequence of numbers is a stair, if the difference between consecutive numbers is always the same. For example, "2, 3, 4, 5" and "10, 7, 4" are stairs. Note that any sequence with only one or two numbers is also a step ladder!
Problem: Given a sequence of numbers, determine how many ladders there are. But we are only interested in staircases as long as possible. So, if a ladder is a piece of another, we only consider the largest. For example, in the sequence "1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 4, 8, 12" we have 4 different stairs: "1, 1, 1", "1, 3, 5", "5, 4" and " 4, 8, 12 "
